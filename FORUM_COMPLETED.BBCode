[center][size=3][i]Tonight, you are out in the woods. As a cat.[/i][/size][/center]

[center]This is a first person game where you control a cat, using mouse and keyboard, use WASD for walking, mouse to look around, click to scratch, and shift to run around. After you run you may sit around to breath a bit and look around.[/center]
[center]I made this game on late nights, using headphones, so it's intended to be played like this. This is a very short game.[/center]
